# click-the-cat-2

This is a toy web-app I wrote to flex my web developments skills.

It's easy to use: Choose a cat; increase it's click count by clicking on its image. Edit any cats data by pressing on the red 'Admin' button.

This web-app is front-end only. It uses a bootstrap responsive layout for the look, Knockout.js for the data binding and jQuery Validation for the form validation.
